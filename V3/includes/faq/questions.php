						<strong>Can I access my data anywhere?</strong><br/>
						Yes. You can access your data through a cloud drive.<br/><br/>
 
						<strong>Does the app have learning capabilities?</strong><br/>
						Yes. Artificial intelligence allows the system to learn about the user’s body and give insight on his/her performance.<br/><br/>

						<strong>Am I able to set training goals?</strong><br/>
						Yes. In addition to guiding movement, the system is designed to be motivational tool as well, enabling you to set goals and track your progress over time.

						<strong>How long does the battery last?</strong><br/>
						The battery allows for 4 hours of continuous motion capture.<br/><br/>

						<strong>When will it be available?</strong><br/>
						We are working hard on delivering our first versions of the garments in 2015.<br/><br/>

						<strong>How do I wash the garment?</strong><br/>
						Throw it in your washing machine! The garment is very durable and completely waterproof.  Just make sure it’s a cold wash and air-dry before wearing.

						<strong>I’m a coach - can I monitor each athlete on my team simultaneously?</strong><br/>
						Yes. Using the web dashboard, you can keep track of each athlete on the team. The dashboard allows you to monitor performance (both individual and aggregated), and provides indicators so you can specifically cater to their individual movement needs.<br/><br/>

						<strong>Can I access information collected on my athletes away from the gym, field, rink, or racetrack?</strong><br/>
						Yes – you can access the web dashboard from anywhere through a cloud drive. <br/><br/>

						<strong>What does the garment track on my athletes?</strong><br/>
						The garment tracks a number of variables, including movement accuracy, joint and limb position over time, speed of movement, force applied to the joints, routine completion rate, and injury risk factor.<br/><br/>

						<strong>What does the web dashboard display?</strong><br/>
						The web dashboard displays information including user profiles, injury profiles, skill level, calibration data, paired-devices tracking, recorded movements, recorded scores, user objectives, routine playlists, rankings, and performance metrics.

						<strong>How does the system recognize me?</strong><br/>
						Once you put on the garment and select your user profile, you will be guided through a set of predefined poses in order to calibrate the system.<br/><br/>

						<strong>Does it take my prior or current injuries into account?</strong><br/>
						Yes. In addition to identifying underlying biomechanical issues that are likely to result in injury, athletes who are injured can use Heddoko™ during the rehabilitation process to track movement in order to optimize recovery (i.e. limiting specific movements to avoid aggravating the existing injury).<br/><br/>

						<strong>What type of coaching feedback does the system provide?</strong><br/>
						Heddoko provides both real-time audio and visual feedback to improve movement precision and performance. Additionally, the garment is equipped with haptic sensors that provide vibrational feedback to indicate correct/incorrect movements.<br/><br/>

						<strong>How will the system help me to improve my performance?</strong><br/>
						Heddoko guides you towards moving more efficiently in real time by providing annotations on the 3D model that articulate specifically what needs to be adjusted. Additionally, our “ghost feature” allows you to track and record your performance and compare yourself in real time either to a past performance or a “gold standard” (i.e. an expert executing the same movement).
